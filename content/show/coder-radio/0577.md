It had served Google the two-year-old startup, and had now scaled to support Google the public company. In fact, around that time, a lucky Google engineer had just snagged PR #20,000,000.

  * [We created the first open-source implementation of Meta‚Äôs TestGen‚ÄìLLM](https://www.codium.ai/blog/we-created-the-first-open-source-implementation-of-metas-testgen-llm/ "We created the first open-source implementation of Meta‚Äôs TestGen‚ÄìLLM") ‚Äî In February, Meta researchers published a paper titled Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta, which introduces a tool they called TestGen-LLM.

  * [Apple‚Äôs Longer-Lasting Devices, iOS 19 and Apple Intelligence on the Vision Pro ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4 "Apple‚Äôs Longer-Lasting Devices, iOS 19 and Apple Intelligence on the Vision Pro ") ‚Äî Apple‚Äôs strategy to make its devices last longer will mean AI and software are even more important to its business.

  * [Apple Intelligence coming to Vision Pro headset, some features could eventually be paid ](https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro-headset-some-features-could-eventually-be-paid-3540671/ "Apple Intelligence coming to Vision Pro headset, some features could eventually be paid ") ‚Äî Gurman says that Apple is facing slower hardware upgrades which is why it‚Äôs banking more on service fees and subscriptions for growth
