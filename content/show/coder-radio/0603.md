  * [Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html "Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory - The Rust Programming Language") ‚Äî Rust‚Äôs memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a memory leak). Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust‚Äôs guarantees, meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. 
  * [Handling memory leaks in Rust - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/handling-memory-leaks-rust/ "Handling memory leaks in Rust - LogRocket Blog") ‚Äî Once in a while, you may experience memory leaks in your Rust projects due to many factors, from unsafe code to shared references, etc. Ideally, you‚Äôll want to fix these memory leaks and ensure your programs are efficient, which may lead to performance gains and resource safety.
  * [Memory leaks are memory safe, and there isn't much to do about it | /home/Samsai](https://samsai.eu/post/memory-leaks-are-memory-safe/ "Memory leaks are memory safe, and there isn't much to do about it | /home/Samsai") ‚Äî Despite their potential for destruction, Rust considers memory leaks "memory safe" and thus doesn't aim to prevent them. Rust's design, however, makes it less easy to create memory leaks, since it uses a Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern to abstract resource allocation and deallocation.
